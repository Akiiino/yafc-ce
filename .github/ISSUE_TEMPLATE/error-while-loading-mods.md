- Be sure that you are using the latest version of YAFC
- Try to remove outdated and disabled mods from your mod folder. If that helps, you may still make a report but you need to attach the whole contents of your mod folder, ioncluding all outdated and disabled mods.
- Please note that YAFC is my personal project and I can't promise any support!
- Specify the YAFC version and Factorio version
- While YAFC should work with mods down to Factorio 0.17 (and maybe even earlier), I actively support only latest stable and latest experimental versions.
- Attach a new game save file so I can sync mods to yours.
