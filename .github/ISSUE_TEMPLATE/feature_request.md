- Feature request is something that you would like to see in YAFC.
- Please note that YAFC is my personal project and I can't promise any support!
- Smaller features that does not conflict with existing functionality have more chances to be implemented sooner.
- Mod-specific mechanics (that are not general Factorio mechanics) are out of scope for YAFC but may be a good idea if I someday add plugin support for YAFC.
